<h1>The Best Movies Accoording To Joe</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Suits</h3>
<p>The series primarily focuses on the dynamic between Harvey, a charismatic and ambitious attorney, and Mike, his brilliant but unlicensed protégé, as they navigate the high-stakes world of corporate law at Pearson Hardman 
    (later Pearson Specter and then Pearson Specter Litt). Throughout the series,Mike struggles to conceal his lack of a law degree while handling complex cases, all while dealing with personal and professional challenges.

<h3>24 HOURS</h3>
<P>"24" is actually a television series rather than a movie. It's a groundbreaking action-packed drama that unfolds in real-time over the course of 24 one-hour episodes, with each episode representing one hour of a single day.
     The show follows Jack Bauer, a counterterrorism agent working for the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU), as he races against the clock to thwart various terrorist plots and save innocent lives.

    <h3>Big Bang Theory</h3> 
<p>The series explores the dynamics of friendship, romance, and geek culture as Leonard, Sheldon, and their group of friends navigate the ups and downs of life. Other main characters include Howard Wolowitz, 
    an aerospace engineer with an overbearing mother; Rajesh Koothrappali, an astrophysicist who struggles with selective mutism around women; and Amy Farrah Fowler and Bernadette Rostenkowski, who respectively become romantic
